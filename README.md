# wirepic

Thread art program. Somewhat janky since I have to manually center the focus of the image. Only improvement is to find a good way to convert images into grayscale while keeping important features dark.


The actual code is located in wire.jl, the image used for testing is in `images` and the output silhouette is `harry_silhouette.png`.
